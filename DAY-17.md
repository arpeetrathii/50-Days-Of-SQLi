DAY 17 : 
* [ ] Hunted on the same program,didn't found SQLi 
* [ ] Learned about functions of SQL from : https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
* [ ] Read the following whitepapers : 
  * https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/assets/2010/2010-06-16/Advanced_SQL_InjectionV2.pdf
  * https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring09/papers/sql_injection.pdf  

Self-realization: Seems like I am not yet prepared to hunt. I have to learn a lot more than normal. And give it a lot of time. Atleast for the next 10 days have to give more than 5hrs to learning everyday.
