# 50-Days-Of-SQLi
Learning and hunting SQL injection bugs for 50 continuous days 

Why am I starting this?
I have always struggled as a bug hunter. I am not able to finding quality bugs. And when you cannot find quality bugs, you can feel the pain. It feels like task done but no satisfaction like you are reporting just for the sake of it. So from now onwards will improve my knowledge first and then will hunt harder to get those quality bugs. So, have thought to first hunt on single bug as the saying goes : Its better to be master of one, than to be jack of all. I will post everything i will read, or refer to and also will try to share my findings (if permitted) with you all. Also will simply post to-dos and short notes. 

# 

My plans (For Learning - 2hrs every single day):
- [ ] Complete SQL injection section from WAHH-v2
- [ ] Complete all labs from Portswigger SQLi labs
- [ ]  Complete all SQLi labs from TryHackMe 
- [ ]  Complete/Read writeups of HackTheBox, Root-me labs
- [ ]  Read the book : SQL Injection Attack and Defense
- [ ]  Read writeups/vlogs related to SQL injection

My plans(For hunting - 2hrs atleast daily from the day I feel like):
- [ ]  Will select certain programs
- [ ]  Hunt each and every parameter of those

Lets see how it goes, if I am able to find any bugs or not! :)
